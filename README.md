# FaceRecogAttendanceSystem
This is the repository of my face recognition attendance system designed as my college project. The face database used is the Yale face data set available online.

The trywali.py file is the main file coded with the GUI and the OpenCV functions used to detect faces in a image i.e. a group picture of the class.
the cascade uploaded is the standard cascade for detecting faces in the openCV environment.
The Yale face data set is available for free online for use.
The file named as first.py is the file used to create the trained model which is then used in the trywali.py file for recognising the faces from the image.
